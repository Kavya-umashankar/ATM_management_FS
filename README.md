1. Before starting up, Run all the C++ files using a complier(used: Mingw compiler) and save the names of files as it is without the cpp extenstion (i.e g++ det.cpp -o det ,after executing this in command line det.exe will be created)
2. We used xampp to run it on the browser and type the url that calls front.php(i.e Starting page of our project)
3. Before going to the customer portal, go to manager portal and register the account number and other details.
